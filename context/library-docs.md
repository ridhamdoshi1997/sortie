# Library Docs

Project-specific usage patterns for every third party library in this project. This file only covers how we use each library in this specific project — rules, patterns, and constraints specific to JobPilot.

Read the relevant section before implementing any feature that touches these libraries.

---

## Before Using Any Library

Before implementing any feature that uses a third party library:

1. **Check AGENTS.md** at the project root — it lists every skill installed for this project and how to use them. Skills contain up-to-date API documentation, usage patterns, and best practices specific to this codebase.

2. **Check if an MCP server is configured** for that library. Some tools have MCP servers that give the AI agent direct access to documentation, logs, and debugging tools. If an MCP server is available — use it before falling back to general knowledge.

3. **Read this file** for project-specific patterns that override general library knowledge.

The order of authority is:

```
MCP server (real-time docs) → Skills via AGENTS.md → This file (project rules) → General training knowledge
```

Never rely on general training knowledge alone for library APIs — they change frequently and training data may be outdated.

---

## InsForge

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed InsForge skill. If an InsForge MCP server is configured — use it. The skill/MCP will have the latest API patterns.

### Client vs Server

Two separate instances — never mix them:

```typescript
// lib/insforge-client.ts — browser context only
import { createBrowserClient } from "@insforge/ssr";

export const insforge = createBrowserClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_INSFORGE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_INSFORGE_ANON_KEY!,
);
```

```typescript
// lib/insforge-server.ts — server context only
import { createServerClient } from "@insforge/ssr";
import { cookies } from "next/headers";

export const createInsforgeServer = async () => {
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  return createServerClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_INSFORGE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_INSFORGE_ANON_KEY!,
    {
      cookies: {
        getAll: () => cookieStore.getAll(),
        setAll: (cookiesToSet) => {
          cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) =>
            cookieStore.set(name, value, options),
          );
        },
      },
    },
  );
};
```

**Rules:**

- Browser client — Client Components, browser-side auth state, realtime subscriptions
- Server client — Server Components, API routes, Server Actions, agent functions
- Never use browser client in server context
- Never use server client in browser context

---

### Auth

```typescript
// Get current user in server context
const insforge = await createInsforgeServer();
const {
  data: { user },
  error,
} = await insforge.auth.getUser();
if (!user) redirect("/login");
```

---

### DB Queries

```typescript
// Read
const { data, error } = await insforge
  .from("jobs")
  .select("*")
  .eq("user_id", user.id)
  .order("found_at", { ascending: false });

// Insert
const { data, error } = await insforge
  .from("jobs")
  .insert({ user_id: user.id, title, company, match_score })
  .select()
  .single();

// Update
const { error } = await insforge
  .from("jobs")
  .update({ company_research: dossier })
  .eq("id", jobId)
  .eq("user_id", user.id); // always scope to user
```

**Rules:**

- Always scope queries to `user_id` — never query without user filter
- Always handle the `error` return — never assume success
- Use `.single()` when expecting exactly one row

---

### Storage

```typescript
// Upload file
const { data, error } = await insforge.storage
  .from("resumes")
  .upload(`${userId}/resume.pdf`, fileBuffer, {
    contentType: "application/pdf",
    upsert: true, // overwrites existing file
  });

// Get public URL
const { data } = insforge.storage
  .from("resumes")
  .getPublicUrl(`${userId}/resume.pdf`);

const url = data.publicUrl;
```

**Storage paths:**

- Base resume: `resumes/{user_id}/resume.pdf`

**Rules:**

- Always use `upsert: true` for base resume uploads — overwrites existing file
- Always save the public URL back to the DB after upload
- Never write files to disk — always upload buffer directly to storage

---

## Adzuna API

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed Adzuna skill. If none exists — use this file and the official Adzuna API docs.

### Job Search

```typescript
// lib/adzuna.ts
export async function searchJobs(
  jobTitle: string,
  location: string,
  country: string = "us",
): Promise<AdzunaJob[]> {
  const params = new URLSearchParams({
    app_id: process.env.ADZUNA_APP_ID!,
    app_key: process.env.ADZUNA_APP_KEY!,
    what: jobTitle,
    category: "it-jobs", // always filter to IT jobs
    results_per_page: "10",
    "content-type": "application/json",
  });

  // Only add where if location is provided
  if (location) {
    params.set("where", location);
  }

  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.adzuna.com/v1/api/jobs/${country}/search/1?${params}`,
  );

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Adzuna API error: ${response.status}`);
  }

  const data = await response.json();
  return data.results || [];
}
```

### Response Shape

Each Adzuna job result contains:

```typescript
type AdzunaJob = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  company: { display_name: string };
  location: { display_name: string };
  description: string; // snippet only — not full description
  redirect_url: string; // Adzuna tracking URL → redirects to actual job
  salary_min?: number;
  salary_max?: number;
  salary_is_predicted: "0" | "1"; // "1" means salary is estimated
  contract_type?: string;
  created: string; // ISO date string
  category: { tag: string; label: string };
};
```

### Saving Jobs to DB

```typescript
// Map Adzuna result to jobs table
const jobRecord = {
  user_id: userId,
  run_id: runId,
  source: "search", // always 'search' for Adzuna jobs
  source_url: job.redirect_url,
  external_apply_url: job.redirect_url,
  title: job.title,
  company: job.company.display_name,
  location: job.location.display_name,
  salary: job.salary_min
    ? `$${Math.round(job.salary_min / 1000)}k - $${Math.round(job.salary_max! / 1000)}k`
    : null,
  job_type: job.contract_type || "fulltime",
  about_role: job.description, // Adzuna returns snippet — used as description
  match_score: scoredJob.matchScore,
  match_reason: scoredJob.matchReason,
  matched_skills: scoredJob.matchedSkills,
  missing_skills: scoredJob.missingSkills,
  found_at: new Date().toISOString(),
};
```

**Rules:**

- Always include `category=it-jobs` — never search Adzuna without this filter
- Never pass `where` if location is empty — omit the parameter entirely
- `source` is always `'search'` for Adzuna jobs — never any other value
- `salary_is_predicted: "1"` means Adzuna estimated the salary — this is normal
- Always display "Jobs by Adzuna" credit on job listings — 116x23px minimum linked to adzuna.com
- Adzuna description is a snippet — GPT-4o scores from it, not a full description
- Default country to `'us'` — support `gb`, `au`, `ca` as alternatives

## Jina Reader (company page fetching)

**Replaced Browserbase + Stagehand on 2026-07-22** — a cost decision, not a bug fix. Browserbase's free tier is 1 browser-hour/month *total* (not per user), and self-hosting headless Chromium on Vercel Hobby is a real engineering risk (Stagehand's own docs recommend Browserbase specifically *because* Vercel serverless functions can't reliably run a bundled Chromium binary — size/memory/cold-start limits). Jina Reader renders the page in a real browser on *their* infrastructure and returns clean markdown — no browser to host at all, genuinely free at this app's volume, verified live against a real JS-rendered site during the swap.

### Fetching a page

```typescript
async function fetchViaJinaReader(url: string): Promise<string | null> {
  const jinaKey = process.env.JINA_API_KEY; // optional — raises rate limit, not required
  const headers: Record<string, string> = { Accept: "text/plain" };
  if (jinaKey) headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${jinaKey}`;

  const response = await fetch(`https://r.jina.ai/${url}`, {
    headers,
    signal: AbortSignal.timeout(25000), // Jina's typical latency is ~7.9s; leave real headroom
  });

  if (!response.ok) return null;
  const text = await response.text();
  return text.trim() || null;
}
```

**Rules:**

- No API key required for basic use — `JINA_API_KEY` is optional, only raises the rate limit (10M free tokens on a free key)
- Always set a real timeout (`AbortSignal.timeout`) — this is a plain `fetch()`, nothing enforces one for you
- Returns markdown, including anchors as `[text](url)` — link discovery for sub-pages is a plain regex pass over that markdown (`extractMarkdownLinks` in `agent/research.ts`), not an AI call
- `visited: boolean` must be threaded through any research result — `true` only when a real fetch succeeded. Never let a downstream LLM call cite a URL as a source when nothing was actually fetched (this exact bug shipped once — a guessed fallback homepage URL got cited as a "source" by the model when no real research had happened).

### Company Research Pattern

Three-step process: homepage fetch+extract → sub-page fetch+extract → provider-selected synthesis. Job description and user profile come from DB — never re-fetch what you already have. See `agent/research.ts`'s `collectBrowserResearch`/`synthesizeDossier` for the full current implementation; this is the shape, not a copy-paste snippet (the real file is the source of truth).

- Step 1/2 (page fetch + structured extraction) always run on Gemini's fast/cheap tier via `lib/models.ts`'s router, regardless of what provider the user picked — same design as when this ran through Stagehand's own model.
- Step 3 (final dossier synthesis) uses the model router with whatever provider the user selected (`getModel(provider, "smart")`) — never hardcode a specific model here.
- Max 3 sub-pages — same limit as before, just to keep the extraction calls cheap, not a platform constraint anymore.
- If page-fetch research comes back empty (`visited: false`) — still run synthesis with job + profile only, and the prompt/output must make that explicit rather than silently presenting inferred claims as verified.

**Dossier fields:** see `CompanyResearchDossier` in `types/index.ts` — that interface is the current source of truth, not this doc.

### Leadership Team lookup

Deliberately separate from the main auto-populated dossier — opt-in only, triggered by its own button (`components/job-details/LeadershipTeamButton.tsx` → `POST /api/agent/research/leadership`), never runs automatically. Real people's names/titles are the kind of specific, checkable fact an LLM is most likely to get confidently wrong, so this stays gated behind an explicit user action rather than folded into the free auto-populate flow. Tries a short list of common about/team page paths (`LEADERSHIP_PATH_GUESSES` in `agent/research.ts`) via the same Jina fetch + Gemini extraction pattern, stops at the first page with a real roster, returns an empty list (not an error) if none is found.

---

### Structured JSON Response

> **Note:** this example still shows the old hardcoded-`gpt-4o` pattern from before Phase 7's model router (`lib/models.ts`) shipped. It's stale — new code should go through `getModel(provider, tier)` + `complete(...)`, not call the OpenAI client directly like this. Kept here only as a historical reference until this section is properly rewritten; don't copy the hardcoded model string.

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY! });

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  response_format: { type: "json_object" },
  temperature: 0.3,
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "You are a job matching assistant. Return only valid JSON.",
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: `Your prompt here`,
    },
  ],
});

const result = JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content!);
```

**Temperature settings:**

- `0.3` — matching, scoring, extraction, research synthesis — deterministic results
- `0.7` — resume generation — natural variation

**Max tokens:**

- Job matching + scoring: `300`
- Company research synthesis: `800`
- Resume generation: `1000`
- Profile extraction from resume: `800`

**Rules:**

- Use `lib/models.ts`'s `getModel(provider, tier)` + `complete(...)` — never call a provider SDK directly outside that router
- Always use `response_format: { type: 'json_object' }` (or the router's `jsonResponse: true`) for structured data
- Always parse the returned string as JSON — even in JSON mode it's still a string
- Always validate parsed JSON before using — wrap in try/catch (or use a Zod `safeParse`, the pattern used throughout `agent/research.ts`)
- Match threshold is always `MATCH_THRESHOLD` from `lib/utils.ts` — never hardcode 70
- Company research synthesis must always return a complete dossier — never return empty even if page-fetch research failed

---

## PostHog

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed PostHog skill. If a PostHog MCP server is configured — use it. The skill/MCP will have the latest client and server patterns.

### Client Setup (Browser)

```typescript
// lib/posthog-client.ts
import posthog from "posthog-js";

export function initPostHog() {
  if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
    posthog.init(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY!, {
      api_host: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST!,
      capture_pageview: false, // manual pageview tracking
    });
  }
}

// Capture event client-side
posthog.capture("job_found", {
  userId,
  source: "search",
  matchScore: score,
});
```

### Server Setup

```typescript
// lib/posthog-server.ts
import { PostHog } from "posthog-node";

export const createPostHogServer = () =>
  new PostHog(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY!, {
    host: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST!,
    flushAt: 1, // send immediately
    flushInterval: 0, // no batching — Next.js functions are short-lived
  });

// Always use and shutdown in the same function
const posthog = createPostHogServer();
posthog.capture({
  distinctId: userId,
  event: "company_researched",
  properties: { userId, jobId, company },
});
await posthog.shutdown(); // required — ensures event is sent
```

**Rules:**

- Always call `await posthog.shutdown()` in server-side functions — events are lost without it
- `flushAt: 1` and `flushInterval: 0` always set on server client
- Event names must match exactly the list in `code-standards.md`
- Always include `userId` as a property on every server-side event
- Call `posthog.identify(userId)` after login on client side
- Call `posthog.reset()` on logout on client side

## @react-pdf/renderer

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed react-pdf skill. PDF generation APIs can differ from general training knowledge.

### Resume PDF Generation

```typescript
import { renderToBuffer } from '@react-pdf/renderer'
import { Document, Page, Text, View, StyleSheet } from '@react-pdf/renderer'

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  page: { padding: 30, fontFamily: 'Helvetica' },
  section: { marginBottom: 10 },
  heading: { fontSize: 14, fontWeight: 'bold' },
  text: { fontSize: 10 },
})

const ResumePDF = ({ profile }: { profile: Profile }) => (
  <Document>
    <Page size="A4" style={styles.page}>
      <View style={styles.section}>
        <Text style={styles.heading}>{profile.fullName}</Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>{profile.email}</Text>
      </View>
    </Page>
  </Document>
)

// Generate buffer
const buffer = await renderToBuffer(<ResumePDF profile={profile} />)

// Upload directly to InsForge Storage
await insforge.storage
  .from('resumes')
  .upload(`${userId}/resume.pdf`, buffer, {
    contentType: 'application/pdf',
    upsert: true
  })
```

**Supported CSS properties:**
Only use these — others are silently ignored:
`padding, margin, fontSize, color, fontFamily, flexDirection, alignItems, justifyContent, borderRadius, width, height, fontWeight, textAlign, lineHeight`

**Rules:**

- Server-side only — never import in client components
- Always use `renderToBuffer` — not `renderToStream` or `PDFDownloadLink`
- PDF generation only in `app/api/resume/` routes
- Generated buffer uploaded directly to InsForge Storage — never written to disk
- Always save public URL to DB after upload

---

## pdf-parse

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed pdf-parse skill.

### Extract Text from Uploaded Resume

```typescript
import pdf from "pdf-parse";

// In API route handling resume upload
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const formData = await req.formData();
  const file = formData.get("resume") as File;
  const arrayBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer();
  const buffer = Buffer.from(arrayBuffer);

  const pdfData = await pdf(buffer);
  const extractedText = pdfData.text; // raw text content

  // Send to GPT-4o for structured extraction
}
```

**Rules:**

- Server-side only — never import in client components
- `pdfData.text` is raw unformatted text — GPT-4o handles the structure extraction
- Always handle parse errors — some PDFs are image-based and return empty text
- If `pdfData.text` is empty or very short — return error to user: "Could not extract text from this PDF. Please try a different file."
